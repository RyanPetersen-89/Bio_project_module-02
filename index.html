        <h1>About Me<figure style="float: left;"><img src="./assets/images/Ryan_portrait.jpg" alt="Picture of Ryan" width="150px"></figure></h1>
        <p>My name is Ryan Petersen, I am 34 years old,
          and I am in the process of a career change. For
          the last few years I have been a home inspector
          driving all over the state for inspections. Most
          recently I am a Quality Inspector for a company
          called Connect-Homes that worked on modular home
          builds, but I recently found out that the
          company is relocating out of state. With that
          news I made the decision to pursue Fullstack
          Development which has been something that I've
          been interested in for years now. I am very
          excited for this course and look forward to
          growing as an individual, as well as expanding
          my skillset into a career that I find
          fullfilling.
